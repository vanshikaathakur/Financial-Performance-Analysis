Financial Performance Analysis Notebook 📊
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Financial Performance Analysis (1).ipynb) that performs an in-depth analysis of financial data. The notebook covers data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and potentially predictive modeling to understand and forecast financial performance.

Overview
This notebook is designed to analyze financial datasets to identify key trends, measure profitability, and gain insights into sales performance across various segments, countries, and products. It includes steps for preparing raw financial data for analysis and building predictive models.

Features
Data Loading: Efficiently loads financial data from a CSV file. 📥

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handles missing values, cleans inconsistent data formats (e.g., currency symbols, parentheses for negative numbers), and ensures appropriate data types for numerical analysis. 🧹

Feature Engineering: Extracts and creates time-based features (e.g., Month, Quarter, Year) to facilitate time-series analysis. ⚙️

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes key financial metrics to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies within the data. 📈

Correlation Analysis: Examines the relationships between different financial variables. 🔗

Predictive Modeling: Implements regression techniques to forecast financial outcomes. 🔮

Installation
To run this notebook, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

Clone the repository (if applicable):

Bash

git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
(Note: As this is a single file upload, replace with appropriate instructions if the user intends to share it as part of a larger project.)

Create a virtual environment:

Bash

python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

Windows:

Bash

.\venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux:

Bash

source venv/bin/activate
Install the required libraries:

Bash

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Usage
Place the data file: Ensure that the Financials.csv file is in the same directory as the notebook, or update the file path in the notebook accordingly.

Python

df = pd.read_csv("Financials.csv")
(Note: The original notebook path r"C:\\Users\\nt397\\Downloads\\Financials.csv" should be updated for portability.)

Open the notebook:

Bash

jupyter notebook "Financial Performance Analysis (1).ipynb"
Run the cells: Execute each cell sequentially to perform the data analysis and observe the results.

Data Source
The notebook expects a CSV file named Financials.csv containing financial transaction data. The expected columns include, but are not limited to:

Segment

Country

Product

Discount Band

Units Sold

Manufacturing Price

Sale Price

Gross Sales

Discounts

Sales

COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)

Profit

Date

Month Number

Month Name

Year

Notebook Structure
The notebook is structured into several logical sections:

Import Libraries: Imports necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning. 📦

Load Data: Reads the financial data into a pandas DataFrame. 📂

Initial Data Inspection: Checks for null values, data types, and column names. 🧐

Data Cleaning: Standardizes column names and converts financial columns to numeric types by removing currency symbols, commas, and handling parenthetical negative values. 🧼

Data Type Conversion: Ensures all relevant columns are in the correct numerical format (float). 🔢

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the data's distribution and relationships. 📊

Feature Engineering: Derives new features from existing ones to enhance the analysis. 🛠️

Model Building: Implements a regression model (e.g., regression.predict(X_test)) for forecasting. 🧠

Key Analysis Points
The notebook focuses on analyzing:

Overall financial performance metrics like Sales, COGS, and Profit. 💰

Performance across different Segments and Countryes. 🌍

Profitability and sales figures for various Products. 📈

Impact of Discount Bands on sales and profit. 🏷️

Temporal trends in financial data (monthly, yearly). 🗓️

Libraries Used
